###   1. Introduction
For an improve production and customer satisfaction, our IfeKaNdu Contractors Company of Nigeria ltd. through its management is to embark on the installation of an Assembly Line of Maintenance Machines. The scale up involves the installation of one (1) drilling machine at the cost of eight thousand, five hundred dollars ($8,500) and also the installation of five (5) injection machines at the cost of eighty thousand dollars ($80,000) for each of the injection machines. The company’s resources will be for the
project and will be spent on some resource persons and materials to the tune of $443,800 .The expected duration of the project is no longer than 85 days.
The following is a tabular representation of the company’s resource persons that will be used during the project.



|   Name                	|Designation      	| Role
| ------------------------------| -------------		| -----------------------|
|K. Tan				|Manager		|Approval of project
|J. Wilson 			|Technical Manager	|Ordering of machines and project materials
|T. Gunter			|Chief Accountant	|Ensures the arrival of machines and other project materials
|T. McMaster			|Electrician		|Runs the cables for all the machines
|B. Farmer			|Fitter			|Installation of machines and project materials
|B. Picossi			|Technical Assistant #1	|Unpacking, drilling and testing machines
|B. Barnes			|Technical Assistant #2	|Unpacking, drilling and testing machines


###   2. Objective of the Project
The objective of the project is a plan and execution for the internal installation and implementation of an assembly line of five (5) new injection maintenance machines at a cost of $80,000 each and one(1) new drilling machine at a cost of $8,500 without outsourcing any human resource but rather using the company’s existing personnel.
###   3. Delivered Requirements for the project:

+ Five(5) new injection maintenance machines
+ One(1) new drilling machine
+ Electrical cables, cement etc.
+ Fitters and other necessary equipment

###   4. Project Milestones

Project plan started on the 3rd of June 2019 with the task of project approval.
Ordered machines and other necessary equipment were received on the 17th June.
Machine installation is from July 30th to August 8th
Final commissioning takes place on August 13th
###   5. Customer Review
Engr. Echezona Uzodinma

###   6. Assumptions

The Chief Accountant supervised the arrival of machines and necessary equipment in order for the task Management approval to have a predecessor, I assumed that there is a package management meeting to deliberate on the importance of the installation before making it known to the Management for approval. The task was done by the Technical Manager Although the Electricians cannot work on installations on weekdays in order not to interrupt
power supply, they still worked on other jobs beside installations on week days. I assumed that some tasks have relationships other than the default finish to start relationship example the new plastic injection machines and the drilling machine can be unpacked the same time hence giving them a start to start relationship.
All the company’s human resources for the project will be reporting via the Chief Accountant or the Technical manager to the Manager. The Fitter and the two Technical Assistants will be reporting to the Technical manager.
Since 1⁄2 a day is will be allowed for the unpacking of each machine, I assumed to use Technical Assistant #1 to unpack 5 injection maintenance machines and to use Technical Assistant #2 to unpack the drilling machine.
The project will be commissioned by the Manager.

###   7. Project Summary
We will be installing five (5)new injection maintenance machines and one (1) drilling machine. The project is expected to last not more than 85 days. The resource persons are from the company staff. The planned
cost of this project is $443,800 and the entire human resource team are seven (7) in number.

**NOTE Figure 1:The diagram for the project summary can be seen at the PM_report_ifekandu_airline_diagram.pdf file**


### 8. WORK BREAKDOWN STRUCTURE:
Work breakdown structure (WBS) is a key tool in project management that organizes a team’s work
into manageable sections. Below is the WBS of our project showing in a compact form all the
activities carried out to realize this project.

**NOTE Figure 2&3:The diagram for the work breakdown structure can be seen at the PM_report_ifekandu_airline_diagram.pdf file**

###   9. DEPENDENCY MATRIX
The Dependency matrix is the type of interactions and relationships that tasks have with each other.
Here the majority of relationships is in the form of finish-to-Start. In the below table, The Installation Project is the Master task which has tasks like the Management Approval and Project Requirement as children.
The management approval has project approval and installation project Approval as sub task. The project Requirements task has Order Placement, unpack machines, Lay the machine foundation, Installation, Power supply connection and commissioning as sub tasks The management approval has a finish-to-start relation with maintenance management meeting in order words the management wouldn’t have approved the project without the suggestion of the Packaging team/unit to the company’s Manager which eventually orders for the machines and materials required to start to project.The Project Requirements have eight(8) sub tasks which are directly dependent on each other in mostly
finish-to-start dependency type.

**NOTE Figure 4:The diagram for the dependency matrix can be seen at the PM_report_ifekandu_airline_diagram.pdf file**

Dependency Matrix
From the above, it means that the Activity/task event that :
+ The Project Approval is dependent on is the Package Management meeting which must have
discussed the importance of Installation first before making it known to the Manager for
approval.

+ Installation project Approval task depends on the entire project to be approved.
+ The ordering of the machines and necessary equipment depends on when the orders were made.
+ laying the machines foundations depends on when materials such as cement arrived.
+ Laying of the cabling, depends on when the foundations have hardened.
+ The installation of the machines depends on the laying of the machine foundations and their subsequent hardening.
+ Power supply connections depends on the machine installation
+ The commissioning depends on the successful testing of the machines

###   10. ACTIVITY ON ARROW (AOA)

This graphical network is another tool that helped in visualizing the lengths of all activities. With this ,the critical path for the project which is the longest length of time it will take to complete the project task can be calculated .From the figure below the critical path is gotten as (B,D,E,H,J,N,P,Q,T,W) which gives a total time of 52.25days.



|  NUMBER                	|ACTIVITY      	        | TIME(DAYS)             | DEPENDENT PREDECESSORS |

The Above is the Activity On Arrow diagram. The critical path from the above is B,D,E,H,J,N,P,Q,T,W

###   11 The execution stage scenarios:

+ During the execution of the project, there was a delay of 2 day on arrival of machines and materials
+ On June 20 th , K. Tan, the manager, is celebrating his birthday and nobody works for the second half of the day (i.e. works is until 1 pm).
+ On the installation program, the last injection machine to be installed is found to be damaged with spare parts taking 7 days to arrive.
+ At the time of the installation of the first drilling machine, the fitter falls ill and is away for 7 days.

**NOTE Figure 6:The diagram for the Gantt Chart can be seen at the PM_report_ifekandu_airline_diagram.pdf file**
###   12. EVM technique application
Since our project has already completed the days of the planned project as per our Gantt chart above.
Our total budget now becomes $20000 + the machines cost which is $408,800 = $428800
The current amount of money spent in the project 

```
W = 44125(5+1) + 14500= $279250 

Since One drilling machine and one Injection machine are still to be installed and tested the EVM becomes
```
EVM = 4* ( $428800 ) = $1715200
###   13. S Curve for Planning / Execution stages

Cumulative data for S Curve
As S Curve is one of the major tools used in the management of projects which help in the tracking of the projects progress over time or the duration of the project. S curves show a graphical display of cumulative man hours, progress or other quantities plotted against time or duration.

Below are both the S curves of the planning and the execution stages. The Curves were gotten by plotting The Actual Cost against the Actual duration for the Execution stage and for the planing stage S Curve, the cost was plotted against the duration.
The curve represents the cumulative data in cost done over time hence the shape gives us the rate of cost over time.
