### Installing a Maintenance Line of an airline company
This scenerio has been designed to provide enough information to enable development of a project plan. In the planning stage, it is required that one determines tasks, some durations, predecessors and allocate resources accordingly.

### The Scenario:
You have been asked to design a project for the internal installation and implementation of a Maintenance Line of an airline company
line of 5 new plastic injection machines ($80,000= each) and 1 new drilling machines ($8,500= each)
using the company existing personnel. 

### The requirements are:
+ Ordering the machines
+ Unpack the imported pre-ready machines for installation
+ Lay the machine foundations
+ Lay electrical cabling
+ Installation
+ Connect the machine to power supply
+ Commissioning

### NOTE:
The project is planned to start on, Monday, June 3rd 2019. THE EXPECTED DURATION OF THE PROJECT IS NO LONGER THAN 85 DAYS.
The schedule will be based on a standard 40-hour working week, and consider that the following day is a holiday: Monday June 10th.

### The project planning should allow for:
+ Management’s Approval of project (allow 3 days, 3 hours cost) - Manager
+ Machines have to be ordered (1 day, 6= hours cost) – Technical manager.
+ Management’s Approval of installation project once the machines have arrived (allow 5days, 2hours cost) - Manager.
+ Order necessary equipment, Electrical cables, cement, etc. costing $9,700= (1 day, 4 hours cost) – Technical manager.
+ Machines and necessary equipment arrival will take 3 weeks – 21 days.
+ Allow 7 days for foundations to harden – Technical Assistants and fitter take 1 day doing this.
+ Allow 3 days for cabling work for all machines - Electrician.
+ Allow 1⁄2 a day unpacking per machine – Technical Assistant.
+ An injection machine is estimated to take 2 days to be installed by two people – A Technical Assistant and a Fitter
+ A drilling machine is estimated to take 4 days to be installed by two people – A Technical Assistant and a Fitter.
+ Testing each injection machine is estimated to take 4 hours (1⁄2 a day) each – One Technical Assistant.
+ Testing each drilling machine is estimated to take 6 hours each - One Technical Assistant.
### Note: You might notice that some tasks have duration and cost that are not equal, e.g. allow 4 days and 7 hours cost. Both are used as they are, duration will affect the Gantt chart and activity network,but the cost is effective working time associated to the task and therefore its cost.

The company's resources are as follows:
```
K. Tan	       - Manager                   $80/hr
J. Wilson      - Technical Manager         $60/hr
T. Gunther     - Chief Accountant          $45/hr
T. McMaster    - Electrician       	   $35/hr        
B. Farmer      - Fitter                    $30/hr
B. Picossi     - Technical Assistant #1    $25/hr
B. Barnes      - Technical Assistant #2    $25/hr
```
The following has to be taken into account:

**NB** 
+ Electricians can only work on the installation during weekends, so as to not interrupt power supply (rate of labour per hour on weekends is 1.25).
+ Two people are required to install a machine (a fitter and a technical assistant).
+ Testing can be done once installed and during weekdays.

### The project should be implemented by showing information about the following:
+ A WBS for the project including personnel costs using ProjectLibre.
+ A Dependency Matrix of the project as per lecture slides.
+ AOA Network identifying times and Critical Path as per lecture slides.
+ A Gantt Chart of the plan. It could be one of:
