### The project Execution events should allow for:

+ During execution of the project, there was a delay of 2 day on arrival of machines and materials.

+ On June 20 th , K. Tan, the manager, is celebrating his birthday and nobody works for the second half of the day (i.e. works is until 1 pm).

+ On the installation program, the last injection machine to be installed is found to be damaged with spare parts taking 7 days to arrive.

+ At the time of the installation of the first drilling machine, the fitter falls ill and is away for 7 days.

### There should also be:

+ A Gantt Chart which includes the baseline (plan) and execution (it means there are two Gantt charts in one: a "plan" one and a "real" one) done using projectLibre although it can also be done using MS Excel.
+ S-Curve as per lecture slides including plan and execution.
+ Apply the EVM technique by calculating and EXPLAINING all results given that:
+ The project has already completed the days of the planned project as per your Gantt chart,
+ The total budget for the project was $20000= plus the machines cost,o The current amount of money spent in the project, W, is calculated with the following
+ equation: W = 44125(X + Y) + 14500
+ One drilling machine and one injection machine are still to be installed and tested (costs associated to installation are under prorate of planned project)
